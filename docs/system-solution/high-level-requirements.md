# Formal Requirements Document: Image Processing Service

## 1. Inferred Business Goals

Based on the technical and product documentation, the primary business goals for this system are:

- **Provide a Self-Service Image Processing Platform:** Offer a user-friendly, web-based tool that allows customers to perform common image transformations without needing specialized software or technical expertise.
- **Achieve High User Adoption and Satisfaction:** By prioritizing a simple, low-friction user experience (inspired by remove.bg), the goal is to attract and retain users, encouraging repeat usage.
- **Enable Efficient Service Delivery:** Automate the image processing workflow through an asynchronous, task-based architecture to handle user requests efficiently and at scale.
- **Establish a Foundation for Future Growth:** Build the application on a modern, scalable technology stack (Next.js, Django, S3) that can be extended with more advanced features and accommodate a growing user base.

## 2. User Roles & Stories

### User Roles

- **Unregistered Visitor:** A user who has not created an account.
- **Registered User:** A user who has signed up and can access the core features of the application.

### User Stories

**Unregistered Visitor:**

- As an Unregistered Visitor, I can view the homepage and understand the service's capabilities, so that I can decide whether to sign up.
- As an Unregistered Visitor, I can access the registration page, so that I can create a new account.

**Registered User:**

- As a Registered User, I can log in with my credentials, so that I can access my account and manage my images.
- As a Registered User, I can upload an image via a simple drag-and-drop interface, so that I can quickly start the transformation process.
- As a Registered User, I can view a list of all my uploaded images, so that I can manage my image history.
- As a Registered User, I can select an uploaded image and apply various transformations (e.g., crop, resize, rotate, filter), so that I can modify it to meet my needs.
- As a Registered User, I can track the real-time status of an ongoing transformation task, so that I know when the processing is complete.
- As a Registered User, I can view and download the final processed image, so that I can use it elsewhere.
- As a Registered User, I can view a dashboard that shows my entire history of source and transformed images, so that I have a centralized place to manage my assets.
- As a Registered User, I can change my password, so that I can maintain account security.
- As a Registered User, I can log out of the application, so that my session is securely terminated.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Authentication

- **FR001:** The system shall allow new users to register for an account using a username, email, and password.
- **FR002:** The system shall authenticate users via a login endpoint.
- **FR003:** The system shall use JWT for session management, with tokens stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies.
- **FR004:** The system shall provide a mechanism for users to log out.
- **FR005:** The system shall protect application routes to prevent access by unauthenticated users.
- **FR006:** The system shall provide a password reset functionality via email.

### 3.2. Image Management

- **FR007:** The system shall allow authenticated users to upload images (e.g., JPEG, PNG) via a drag-and-drop interface.
- **FR008:** The system shall validate uploaded files based on type and size on the client side.
- **FR009:** The system shall store uploaded images in an S3 bucket.
- **FR010:** The system shall provide a dashboard where users can view a list of their uploaded source images and transformed images.
- **FR011:** The system shall allow users to view a detail page for each source image.

### 3.3. Image Transformation

- **FR012:** The system shall allow users to apply one or more of the following transformations to an image:
  - Crop (width, height, x, y)
  - Resize (width, height)
  - Rotate (degrees)
  - Filters (grayscale, sepia, blur)
  - Watermark (text)
  - Flip
  - Mirror
- **FR013:** The system shall process image transformations as asynchronous tasks.
- **FR014:** The system shall provide real-time status updates for pending transformation tasks (e.g., PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED).
- **FR015:** The system shall allow users to view and download the resulting transformed image upon successful completion.
- **FR016:** The system shall display an error message if a transformation task fails.

## 4. Inferred Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - **NR001:** The application must be responsive, with fast initial page loads, leveraging Next.js SSR and code splitting.
  - **NR002:** The UI must provide clear loading states during data fetching and image processing to manage user perception of wait times.
  - **NR003:** API interactions for server state (fetching, caching, synchronization) must be efficiently managed by TanStack Query.
- **Scalability:**
  - **NR004:** The frontend architecture must be modular and organized by feature to allow for independent development and scaling of different application parts.
  - **NR005:** The backend's use of asynchronous task processing (Celery/Redis) and S3 for storage implies the system is designed to handle a growing number of users and processing tasks.
- **Security:**
  - **NR006:** Authentication must be secure, using JWTs transmitted via HTTP-only cookies to mitigate XSS attacks.
  - **NR007:** All communication with the backend API must be over HTTPS.
  - **NR008:** Client-side validation (using Zod) must be implemented on all forms to prevent invalid data submission.
- **Usability & Accessibility:**
  - **NR009:** The user interface must be intuitive and simple, especially the core image upload flow.
  - **NR010:** The application must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - **NR011:** UI components must be built with accessibility in mind, leveraging Radix UI primitives.
- **Maintainability:**
  - **NR012:** The codebase must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
  - **NR013:** A consistent code style must be enforced using ESLint and Prettier.
  - **NR014:** The project must follow clear structural conventions (directory layout, file naming, import patterns) to ensure the codebase is easy to navigate and understand.

## 5. Clarifying Questions for the Client

1.  **User Profile Completeness:** The API provides `first_name` and `last_name` fields for a user, but the frontend currently doesn't use them. Are there plans to build out a user profile page or display this information in the UI?
2.  **Image Deletion:** The API documentation does not specify endpoints for deleting source or transformed images. Is image deletion a required feature? If so, what should the user experience be?
3.  **Transformation History:** Should the transformation history on the image detail page be paginated or load infinitely to handle users with many transformations on a single image?
4.  **Error Handling Specificity:** The current plan is for generic toast notifications for errors. Are there specific API errors (e.g., "Not enough credits," "File type not supported") that should be handled with more specific UI feedback?
5.  **Guest/Anonymous Usage:** The current flow requires a user to be authenticated for all core actions. Is there any consideration for allowing anonymous users to perform a limited number of transformations as a trial experience?
6.  **Image Storage Policy:** Is there a retention policy for user-uploaded images and transformation results? For example, are unused images or accounts deleted after a certain period of inactivity?
