# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a transformations section to the Image Detail Page that displays all transformation tasks associated with a source image. The section will show transformation tasks as cards in a horizontal scrollable layout, providing users with a clear overview of all processing operations performed on their image. This enhances the user experience by making it easy to track, review, and access all transformations from a single view.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing an image detail page, I want to see all transformation tasks for that image displayed as cards, so that I can quickly understand what processing has been done on my image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to an image detail page THEN the system SHALL display a transformations section below the main image
2. WHEN transformation tasks exist for the image THEN the system SHALL render each task as a card in a horizontal layout
3. WHEN no transformation tasks exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the transformations section loads THEN the system SHALL fetch transformation data from the API automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with multiple transformations on an image, I want to scroll horizontally through transformation cards, so that I can view all transformations even when there are many.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more transformation cards than fit in the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling functionality
2. WHEN scrolling horizontally THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling behavior
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support touch-based horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN cards overflow the container THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators for scrollable content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing transformation cards, I want to see key information about each transformation, so that I can identify and differentiate between different processing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a transformation card THEN the system SHALL show the transformation type (resize, grayscale, etc.)
2. WHEN displaying a transformation card THEN the system SHALL show the current processing status
3. WHEN displaying a transformation card THEN the system SHALL show the creation timestamp
4. WHEN a transformation has parameters THEN the system SHALL display relevant parameter information
5. WHEN a transformation is completed THEN the system SHALL show a preview thumbnail if available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing transformation cards, I want to see different visual states based on processing status, so that I can quickly understand which transformations are complete, in progress, or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transformation is pending THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator and pending status
2. WHEN a transformation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator if available
3. WHEN a transformation is completed THEN the system SHALL display a success state with result preview
4. WHEN a transformation has failed THEN the system SHALL show an error state with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN displaying status THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual styling for each state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing completed transformations, I want to interact with transformation cards, so that I can access the processed results or view more details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transformation is completed THEN the system SHALL make the card clickable to view results
2. WHEN clicking a completed transformation card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the result page
3. WHEN hovering over a clickable card THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN a transformation is not completed THEN the system SHALL disable card interaction
5. WHEN clicking a card THEN the system SHALL pass the correct task ID for navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the transformations section to be responsive, so that I can view transformations effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display cards with optimal spacing and sizing
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the system SHALL adjust card sizes and spacing appropriately
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure cards remain readable and interactive
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL maintain horizontal scroll functionality
5. WHEN displaying on any device THEN the system SHALL ensure text and images remain legible
